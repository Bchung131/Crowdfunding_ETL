# Crowdfunding_ETL
This project consist of building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, four CSV files will be created and using the CSV data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, uploading the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
